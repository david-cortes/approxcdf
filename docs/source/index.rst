Approximate MVN CDF
===================

This is the documentation page for the `approxcdf` Python package, which provides a fast approximation for the CDF (cumulative distribution function) of MVN (multivariate normal) distributions based on the TVBS (two-variate bivariate screening) method. See project's GitHub page for more details:

Installation
============

The Python version of this package can be easily installed through pip:
::

   pip install git+https://www.github.com/david-cortes/approxcdf.git

(See the GitHub page for more details)

Note that it is only available in source form (not in binary wheel form), which means you will need a toolchain for compiling C++ source code (e.g. GCC in linux, msys2 that comes with anaconda on windows, clang in mac).
